# Movie Theater App

This is a simple web application for a movie theater that allows users to view information about the movies being shown, purchase tickets, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 

## Usage

When the app loads, users can see information about the first movie, including its title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets. The app also displays a menu of all movies on the left side of the page, and allows users to purchase tickets for any available showings.
